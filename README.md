# Freeform Radio Tuner for the Internet

## Background 

[Here is an article](https://medium.com/@phirschybar/freeform-radio-for-the-internet-c8a2b7226756#.xlt7xz1o3) I wrote about my own desire for freeform radio in the digital age.

## Objectives

* Create the definitive playlist/tuner for real, freeform radio streams. 
* Curate a set of playlist files which can be imported into free audio players such as [Vox](https://vox.rocks/) and [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).

## Guidelines. All feeds / stations must be:

* [Freeform Radio Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeform_(radio_format))
* Commercial-free / listener supported
* At least 128k streams
